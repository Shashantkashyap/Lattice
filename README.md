This is Node JS web application.
There might be some issue in mongo server during my app deployment therform it create some issues in current time but i can update in future.
This is my postman api collection:
https://www.postman.com/grey-space-839917/workspace/shashant/collection/29320905-1cf4cf06-226b-4faf-9e34-e25b1cb4e5ce?action=share&creator=29320905.

I had added 1 additional REST API for Psychiatrist login.
I would not create lots of data in database, but you can check the working of api in postman collection.
I would add a feature of OTP validation for email authentication.

All other requirements are fullfilled in the code.

App deployment: .https://front-io6q.onrender.com
